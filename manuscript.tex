\section{Historical Review}
\label{sec:historical_Review}

Gy{\"o}rgy Ligeti, one of the most innovative musicians of modern 20\textsuperscript{th}-century, was born in Hungary to a Jewish family in 1923.
After suffering from two tyrannies in his youth, Nazi and Stalinist, he left Hungary in 1956 facing western Europe (\cite{ligeti_grove}).
There, he was exposed to electronic music through the Darmstadt-Cologne avant guard ideology, which influenced his writing ever since (\cite[p. TODO]{levy2006}).

Karlheinz Stockhausen, probably the most prominent German composer of the 2\textsuperscript{nd} half of the 20\textsuperscript{th}-century, was born in Colone in 1928.
He enrolled at the Cologne Musikhochschule in 1947 and graduated in 1951.
After his graduation Stockhausen went to the Darmstadt Ferienkurse f{\"u}r Neue Music and later moved to Paris, where he met Messiaen, Boulez and Pierre Schaeffer and introduced to the Parisian avant garde and the musique-concr{\`e}te studios.

By 1953 Stockhausen was already established as a leading composer in the serialist avant guard.
Over the next few years he became the leading figure in Darmstadt-Colone avant guard scene and from 1956 started to teach regularly at the Darmstadt summer courses (\cite{stockhausen_grove}).

Gottfried Michael Koenig, was born in 1926 in Magdeburg, Germany.
He studied church music in Braunschweig, composition, piano, analysis and acoustics in Detmold, music representation techniques in Cologne and computer technique in Bonn\footnote{Koenig homepage: www.koenigproject.nl/indexe.html}.
During the 1951 Darmstadt summer courses he attended lectures by Meyer-Eppler that awakened his interest in electronic sound production.
In 1953 he moved to Cologne where he studied music technology at the Cologne Hochschule f{\"u}r Music and attended courses on electronic data processing at the University of Cologne.
At the same time he started to work at the Studio for Electronic Music of the West German Radio (WDR), first as assistant for other composers and later as as a permanent employee and composer (\cite{koenig_grove}).

\section{Esthetic Ideals in Electronic Music}
\label{sec:esthetic_ideals_in_Electronic_music}

\subsection{Ligeti}
\label{sub:eshtetic_ligeti}

TODO Add Frigyesi comments from her paper in the relevant places.

TODO Some introduction: Ligeti citations are self explanatory...

\subsubsection{Hectic quality / Gesticulation / Deep-frozen expressionism}
\label{subs:ligeti:hectic}

I want to remove great, whirling passion, all grand expressive gestures, far away and view them at a distance.
My generation's attitude comes into play here, a rejection of pathos and romanticism (p. 18).

I deprive both pathos and expression of credibility, suddenly everything gets out of gear...
If pathos in a gesture is excessive you can no longer perceive or register it (p. 19).

\subsubsection{Machine like music / Meccanico-type}
\label{subs:ligeti:machine}

I have always been fascinated by machines that do not work properly...
Transposed into music, the ticking of malfunctioning machinery occurs in many of my works (p. 16).

\subsubsection{Micropolyphony}
\label{subs:ligeti:micropolyphony}

Both Atmospheres and Lontano have a dense canonic structure.
But you cannot actually hear the polyphony, the canon.
You hear a kind of impenetrable texture, something like a very densely woven cobweb.
I have retained melodic lines in the process of composition, they are governed by rules as strict as Palestrina’s or those of the Flemish school...
The polyphony structure does not come through, you cannot hear it; it remains hidden in a microscopic, under-water world, to us inaudible (p. 14-15).

\subsubsection{Flexible rhythm}
\label{subs:ligeti:flexible}

What really interested me was flexible rhythm, giving up the pulsating metrical idiom (p. 36).

I built the rhythmic shifts into the music.
For instance, twenty-four violins would play the same tune but with a slight time-lag between them...
No violinist can play them, all of them make mistakes, different mistakes all the time.
These mistakes add up and create a floating, fluctuating patterns (p. 40).

At the time I was interested in the idea of multilayered structures, polyrhythm, and beyond that different tempi, different speed all simultaneously executed (p. 62).

\subsubsection{Overwriting / Misleading notation}
\label{subs:ligeti:overwriting}

My reason for so ‘overwriting’ the score was to achieve the effect I wanted, a sense of danger (p.53).

In a later piece, Ramifications, I divided the strings into two groups with quarter-tone difference in the intonation between them.
This did not produce music based on quarter-tones; that was not my intention...
The point is that as the two groups of strings, deliberately tuned apart from one another, go on playing the group tuned higher automatically slides downwards so that the two groups get nearer one another in pitch.
That is what I wanted: not music based on quarter-tones but mistuned music (p. 54).

...There will be hardly any difference between various performances; the smudginess both in intonation and in rhythm gives the same result, the same degree of ‘dirtiness’ (p. 55).

...The passages written in small notes simply indicates that the player should execute them as fast as he can.
That is why I said that the instrumentalist were not given much freedom; what I kept under control was the overall sound texture at any one time (p. 63).

\subsubsection{``Mistiness'' to ``clearing-up'' process}
\label{subs:ligeti:mistiness}

My idea was that instead of tension-resolution, dissonance-consonance, dominant-tonic, pairs of opposition in traditional tonal music, I would contrast ``mistiness'' with passages of ``clearing-up''. ``Mistiness'' usually means a contrapuntal texture, a micropolyphonic cobweb technique; the perfect interval appears in the texture first as a hint and then gradually becomes the dominant feature (p. 60).

\subsection{Stockhausen}
\label{sub:eshtetic_stockhausen}

On several previous occasions, when I have been asked to explain the composition of electronic music, I have described four characteristics that seem important to me for electronic composition as distinguished from the composition of instrumental music:

\subsubsection{The correlation of the coloristic, harmonic-melodic, and metric-rhythmic aspects of composition}
\label{subs:stockhausen:time}

Most of the current paper by Stockhausen deals with this element.
In my opinion, Stockhausen attitude toward the correlation between different compositional aspects could be put by the two following ideas:

\begin{itemize}
    \item He classify different sonic elements as different perceptions of the time domain.
    For example, periodic elements of short time intervals are intercepted as pitch, and therefore as the basis for melody and harmony;
    Periodic elements of medium time interval are intercepted as tempo and rhythm;
    Those of larger time intervals are seen as musical structure.
    Furthermore, Stockhausen describe those ``time spans'' as spread across 7 octaves:
    Pitch is spread across the 7 octaves of the piano;
    Tempo and rhythm are spread from 1/16 of a second up to 8 seconds;
    Lastly, time spans of 8 to 1024 seconds are intercepted as structural building blocks.

    \item Based on the attitude described above Stockhausen approach electronic music as a tool to apply total serializm (TODO: {total serializm reference}).
    Furthermore, he argues that serializm must exist in electronic composition.
    The thinking path the led Stockhausen to this argument is clear, but it is still hard for me to agree with him.
    Later, I will try to confront this idea with those reflected in his and Ligeti's music.
\end{itemize}

Overall, I can not find a common ground between this compository element to those of Ligeti that were mentioned before.
Their attitudes regarding unified perception of time are, most probably, contradicting.

\subsubsection{The composition and de-composition of timbres}
\label{subs:stockhausen:timber}

Ligeti reference this ideas as following:
Modification of timbre and dynamics are obviously very significant but the patterns emerging from them are even more important...
I should say that the changes and modifications of the overall pattern are the important feature, not the tone colors. (Ligeti in conversation, p. 39).

\subsubsection{The characteristic differentiation among degrees of intensity}
\label{subs:stockhausen:intensity}

I'm not sure I fully understand the meaning of this element, not from the current paper, at least.
I will leave this element ``out of scope'' for now.

\subsubsection{The ordered relationships between sound and noise}
\label{subs:stockhausen:noise}

main area to compare Ligeti and Stockhausen ideas TODO.

\section{Compositions}
\label{sec:compositions}

\subsection{Ligeti: Remifications}
\label{sub:composition_ligeti}

Ligeti ideals and characteristics as found in Remifications.

\subsubsection{Micropolyphony, flexible rhythm and misleading notation}

This ideas are perhaps the most dominants in this composition.
Examples can be found in the 0:00 - 1:55, 4:20 - 4:35, 5:28 - 6:25.

\subsubsection{Machine like music / Meccanico-type}

It appears to me that these idea could be counted together with the previous ones.
On the other hand, some parts in Remifications are dominated by more ``machine-like'' characteristics than others.
For example: 5:28 - 6:25, 7:00 - 8:00.

\subsubsection{Hectic quality / Gesticulation / Deep-frozen expressionism}

Gesticulated phrases appears in Remifications only for short periods, they are not characterize the composition as a hole.
Nevertheless, we can note two ``overly exaggerated'' phrases, where the primer is a bit more distinct in that manner: 3:36 - 3:45, 6:28 - 6:40.
One could argue that these are just dramatic phrases within the composition, but I suspect that this amount of vibrato in Ligeti's composition most present some decent amount of cynicism.
TODO cite frigyesi to support this statement.

\subsubsection{‘Mistiness’ to ‘clearing-up’ process}

In my opinion this idea is the lessen distinct in this composition.
This is probably because of the firm voice that accompanies any of the mictrotonal parts, while the ``mistiness'' microtonal is steady and is not ``clearing-up'' into an perfect interval.
The most relevant parts I managed to find for this idea are: 1:40 - 2:08, 2:19 - 2:38.
